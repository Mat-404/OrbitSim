This was a project I did in the Fall of 2022, which was my first attempt at a simulation program. This program uses a pre-made plot.java In order to create a graph to plot the orbits of celestial bodies relative to each other. The program uses an Euler simulation to methodically calculate the gravitational force between the objects and apply it using kinematic equations.
